# MIDI Fix
- Requires RtMIDI

A solution for the latest update for MacOS not supporting the software for certain MIDI keyboards. A "better than nothing" solution to an otherwise unsolvable problem.

Serves as a virtual instrument that displays as a possible input in DAW software. It sits in the middle of the keyboard and the DAW, translating some MIDI events to others, depending on the layer that is toggled.
